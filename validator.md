# Agent-Aware Workflow Validator

Use this checklist to clarify whether your AI agent idea is solving a real user problem, fits a workflow, and is feasible to build and iterate on.

---

## 1. Job-To-Be-Done Clarity
- ✅ What *exact* user pain does this solve?
- ✅ Who is the user? What’s their context?
- ✅ Is this pain urgent and frequent enough to justify an agent?

---

## 2. Workflow Alignment
- ✅ Where in the user's workflow does this fit?
- ✅ What existing tools or systems does it integrate with?
- ✅ Will this agent replace a manual task or augment it?

---

## 3. Autonomy Level
- ✅ Is this agent making suggestions, decisions, or taking actions?
- ✅ What human-in-the-loop controls are needed?
- ✅ What should happen if the agent gets it wrong?

---

## 4. Value & ROI
- ✅ Can we measure success (time saved, errors reduced, etc.)?
- ✅ Is there a clear before/after benefit?
- ✅ Can we run a small test or prototype before full build?

---

## 5. Ethics, Trust, and Safety
- ✅ Does the agent handle sensitive data?
- ✅ Do we have a plan for explainability or audit logs?
- ✅ Are there risks of bias, misuse, or hallucination?

---

## 6. Build Feasibility
- ✅ Do we have enough context/data to train or prompt the agent?
- ✅ Do we need RAG, fine-tuning, or just clever prompting?
- ✅ Who on the team will build and maintain this?

---

## 7. Team Alignment
- ✅ Has this been reviewed with Product, Design, Eng, and Legal?
- ✅ Do we agree on the scope for v0?
- ✅ Are we ready to run a test or prototype?

> Use this validator before assigning tickets to dev teams. You’ll save time, money, and frustration by aligning early on the agent’s purpose and design.
