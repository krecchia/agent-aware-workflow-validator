# Agent-Aware Workshop Template

Use this template to run a 30–60 minute session with your team before building an AI agent. It helps align everyone on the problem, the agent’s role, and whether it’s worth pursuing.

---

## 🧠 1. Problem Alignment

- What job-to-be-done are we solving?
- Who is the user?
- Why is this painful today?

---

## 🔄 2. Workflow Integration

- Where does this agent fit in the user’s workflow?
- What tools/systems does it need to integrate with?
- Is this replacing or augmenting an existing process?

---

## 🤖 3. Agent Role & Autonomy

- Should it make suggestions, decisions, or take actions?
- Do we need a human in the loop?
- What happens if it gets something wrong?

---

## 📈 4. Value Hypothesis

- How will we measure success?
- What’s the before/after?
- Can we test this in a small way?

---

## ⚠️ 5. Risks & Considerations

- Any data privacy or security issues?
- Potential for hallucination or misuse?
- Plan for trust, explainability, audit?

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Do we build? Wait? Re-scope?
- If building, define scope of v0
- Assign follow-ups (design, tech, PM, etc.)
