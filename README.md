# Agent-Aware Workflow Validator

## Why this exists

AI tools and agents are exploding in popularity — from copilots to assistants to fully autonomous workflows. But many teams jump into building before understanding:

> What exactly is the job this agent is supposed to do?

This repo helps product teams, stakeholders, and solution architects slow down just enough to answer:
- Is the agent solving a real, painful user problem?
- Do we understand the workflow it plugs into?
- Are we clear on what autonomy even looks like here?

## Who it’s for
- Product Managers validating AI ideas before build
- Stakeholders scoping features for engineering
- Cross-functional teams experimenting with LLMs, copilots, or agents
- Devs and AI leads looking to de-risk product/agent ideas

---

## What this helps with

Use this validator before you send dev teams on wild quests building AI agents that:
- Don’t match actual user pain
- Duplicate existing tools
- Try to do too much, or too little
- Can’t be evaluated for ROI, value, or viability

## Core Principles

This toolkit is:
- **Agent-agnostic**: Works whether you’re using Claude, LangChain, Bolt.new, or anything else.
- **Tool-optional**: You don’t need to code anything to use it — it’s for structured thinking first.
- **De-risking-focused**: Built to reduce waste, clarify value, and align the team early.

---

## Example Use Case

Let’s say someone says:

> “Let’s build an agent that automatically summarizes our sales calls and drafts follow-ups!”

Great idea — but does it…
- Solve a job the user hates?
- Integrate with current workflows (CRM, Slack, calendar)?
- Require full autonomy or just suggestion?
- Have a feedback loop to learn and improve?
- Align with your company’s AI ethics, compliance, or auditability needs?
